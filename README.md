> **"Bridging the gap between human emotion and artificial intelligence."**

SENSE AI is a high-fidelity Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) platform powered by deep learning. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human emotions from audio and video signals with over 70% validation accuracy. This project is designed for researchers, developers, and final-year students looking for a production-ready sentiment analysis pipeline.

### 💎 Key Features:
*   **🎭 Reactive UI Theme**: The entire dashboard dynamically shifts its color palette (Angry/Red, Happy/Gold, Calm/Green) based on the detected emotional vector.
*   **🎬 Mixed Media Support**: Effortlessly extract emotions from `.wav`, `.mp3` audio, and `.mp4`, `.mov` video files using automated track stripping.
*   **🎤 Live Voice Capture**: Record directly from your microphone with real-time timers and animated signal pulses.
*   **📊 Deep Signal Metrics**: Instant extraction of **Vocal Tempo (BPM)**, **Mean Pitch (Hz)**, and **Vocal Energy (%)**.
*   **📜 Neural Reports**: Download professional, printable **PDF Reports** containing confidence bars, AI insights, and vocal metrics.
*   **〰️ Waveform Visualizer**: Interactive signal visualization for every processed file.

## 🔬 Technical Methodology

### 1. Data Engineering
We utilized the industry-standard **RAVDESS** and **SAVEE** datasets, providing a balanced exposure to diverse emotional archetypes across both male and female speakers.

### 2. Signal Analysis & Feature Extraction
We employ **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)** via the `Librosa` library. This captures the power spectrum of audio signals, mimicking human auditory perception.
*   **Frequency Doubling**: We double the sampling rate to capture higher-resolution features.
*   **3-Second Normalization**: All signals are windowed to 3s for input consistency.

### 3. Deep Learning Architecture
The core is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** optimized for 1D signal classification. 
*   **Layers**: Conv1D → MaxPooling → Dropout → Dense.
*   **Training**: Optimized via categorical cross-entropy and RMSProp.
*   **Accuracy**: Achieved **70%+ validation accuracy** across 10 emotional classes.

## 💡 Emotion Mapping
The model classifies signals into 10 distinct categories, mapping gender and sentiment with high precision:

| Code | Emotion Label | Code | Emotion Label |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0** | Female Angry | **5** | Male Angry |
| **1** | Female Calm | **6** | Male Calm |
| **2** | Female Fearful | **7** | Male Fearful |
| **3** | Female Happy | **8** | Male Happy |
| **4** | Female Sad | **9** | Male Sad |
